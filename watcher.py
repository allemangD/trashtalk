    Responsible for adding "focus" and "other" team references to play data.

    The data given by the api only deals with teams "home" and "away". For this bot
     it is useful to track the "focus" team and the "other" team.

    This class aliases `game.teams.home` and `game.teams.away` by `game.teams.focus`
     and `game.teams.other`, depending on whether the focused team is home or away.

    It also generates sub-events for events which have an associated team (goals,
     shots, etc). If the play team is the focused team, then the sub-event is
     `<EVENT>.focus`, and similarly with `<EVENT>.other`.

    Finally, the `players` entry in play data is poorly formatted for str.format.
    For example, a goal api response might contain a players list:

    [
      { playerType: Scorer, ... },
      { playerType: Goalie, ... },
    ]

    This is transformed to a dictionary, better suited for str.format:

    {
      Scorer: {...},
      Goalie: {...},
